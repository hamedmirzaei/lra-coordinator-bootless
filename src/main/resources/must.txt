1. each compensation service should return a LRAApplicantCompensationResponseTypeVo object. The field
    messageCode = LRA-0000 in case of success and otherwise fail
2. each service (which is supposed to have a compensation) should receive LRA uuid as its first required input
   => to register the compensation for LRA instance
3. the result of calling a specific compensation service for any number of times should be equal to calling it once
   => in other word a compensation service must be idempotent and assume they might be called more than once
