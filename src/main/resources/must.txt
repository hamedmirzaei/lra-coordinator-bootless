1. each compensation service should return HttpStatus.OK in case of success or not HttpStatus.OK in case of error
2. each service (which is supposed to have a compensation) should receive LRA uuid as its first required input

3. the result of calling a specific compensation service for any number of times should be equal to calling it once
   => in other word a compensation service must be idempotent and assume they might be called more than once
